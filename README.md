### This repository consists of 3 Jupyter notebooks:

1. `heat_transfer_pde.ipynb`, is the main notebook with `Numba` solution for heat transfer. As a final result it generates a **T(x ,y, t)** map.

2. `heat_transfer_pde_upd.ipynb` uses the results of the previous one with experimental data to generate **n(x, y, t)** map.

3.  `image.ipynb` generates the final image of the soy sauce pattern through Raleyigh-Sommerfiled integration in `LightPipes`.
